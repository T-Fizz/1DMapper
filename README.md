# 1DMapper
A mapper for a work in progress rhythm game that may exist in the future

# Do not edit beatmaps with this as it currently overwrites the file that is in the beatmap folder!!!

Currently only supports the placement of notes in a new nonexisting beatmap. Does not support deletion of notes in any fashion, and edits of existing beatmaps. Support for these and more are to come at a later date most likely.
